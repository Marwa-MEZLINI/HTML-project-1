    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, pour ¾ cup (200 ml) of milk or lukewarm water.</li>
        <li>Pour over the yeast and dissolve it. Let stand for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the flour over the dissolved yeast, and add the soft butter (or soft margarine).</li>
        <li>Using the dough hook, knead for 1 minute on low speed. Then, while continuing to knead, gradually
            incorporate the rest of the milk or water.</li>
        <li>Finally add the salt and knead at medium speed for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>The dough should be smooth and homogeneous and come away from the walls of the bowl. If it is too firm, add
            a few tablespoons of warm water. If, on the contrary, it is too wet add 1 or 2 tablespoons of sifted flour.
        </li>
        <li>Lightly flour a large bowl and place the dough in it.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a cloth and let it rise for 1h30, at room temperature, away from drafts. It should at
            least double in size.</li>
        <li>Place the dough on a floured work surface and divide it into 10 pieces.</li>
        <li>Roll each of them on the work surface or between the hands until obtaining 10 sausages of about 20 inches
            (50 cm) in length.</li>
        <li>Then shape the sausages in the shape of a traditional pretzel (<a href=" https://youtu.be/GVXLCUnWHMg">
                https://youtu.be/GVXLCUnWHMg</a>).</li>
        <li>Preheat the convection oven to 430 F (220°C).</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, bring the 2 quarts (2 liters) of water to a boil and add the baking soda.</li>
        <li>Dip each pretzel in for 20 to 30 seconds, one at a time, until they come to the surface.</li>
        <li>Using a large slotted spoon, gradually remove each pretzel from the baking sheet. They must be well spaced
            because they swell during cooking.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle them with coarse salt and bake them for 15 minutes or until they are golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
